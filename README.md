# KernelF 2

Repository for the new, shadow-model based evolution of KernelF:

* Minimal, expressive core: constants, functions, pattern matching
* Functional, Reactive
* Syntactic sugar stacked on top of the core
* Interpreter, generator and verifier as backends
* Connected by realtime transformations based on shadow models.
