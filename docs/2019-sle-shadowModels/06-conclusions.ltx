\section{Conclusions}


At itemis we have had this situation for a few years now: whenever we start to talk
about some new end-user relevant feature, it takes only a few minutes until we end up
with Shadow Models as an important part of the solution; we have several additional 
concrete use cases in mind beyond those described in \sect{examples}. And as we have
outlined in \sect{future} there is still work to do. However, our initial experience
is promising, and we see many of the benefits of Shadow Models that we had hoped
for.
