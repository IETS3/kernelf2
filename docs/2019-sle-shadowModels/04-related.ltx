\section{Related Work}

For space reasons, we compare only superficially to a few related approaches. 
%
The \textbf{MPS Build Pipelines}, although using model-to-model-transformations,
is not incremental. Unsuccessful experiments with running it interactively prompted
the development of Shadow Models. 
%
\textbf{Incremental} transformations are not a new idea; for example, \textbf{VIATRA2}~\cite{varro2016road} 
supports incrementality based on the \textbf{IncQuery}~\cite{ujhelyi2015emf} incremental graph pattern
matching engine. 
\textbf{Dclare for MPS} is another incremental
transformation engine that relies on contraints instead of functional transformations.
%
Shadow Models
is not \textbf{bidirectional}~\cite{stevens2007landscape}; it supports unidirectional
transformations that maintain a trace back, as well as specific APIs to propagate
analysis results back to the source.
Our use cases do not require true bidirectionality, and we decided to go with the
simpler specifications that come with unidirectional transformatioms.
